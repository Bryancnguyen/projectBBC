# projectBBC
This is not BBC, this is an attempt to create a web application that will make resumes look amazing.

Three CS Majors, one project, one world. 
We will change the world using dynamic and innovative ideas to refresh society and the world.

Our promising structure carefully influences the clients. Convergences influence the **partners**.

Bottom lines diligently target the **project leader**.

A full-scale vision **leverages** the siloed **executive talent** across geographies. A wide-ranging upside focus strengthens the responsive structures. We must activate the sphere to take control of our *granular challenges on-the-fly*. The group takes a bite out of our **reality-based market conditions**.
